# Telegram-bot
## Description
It Telegram Bot written on the popular Python library pyTelegramBotAPI.

Its main function is to accommodate a large number of tasks and actions to make the user's life easier. 

Name bot in Telegram:

[@I_canHelpBot](https://web.telegram.org/a/#7350741291)

# What it do
This bot can perform the following actions:
- `/start` - run bot;
- `/help` - list and description of available commands;
- `/weather` - find out the weather in the city;
- `/make_pass` - generate a password;
- `/convert` - currency converter;
- `/calculate` - calculator;
- `/joke` and `/joke_twopart` - send a joke.

# What's next
In the future, I plan to expand the bot and add a bunch more functions and commands to it.

Improve the **`/weather`**, **`/joke`**, **`/start`**, **`/calculate`**, **`/make_pass`** and **`/convert`** commands.

It's really cool.
